# Effective Monorepos

## What is a Monorepo?

> In version-control systems, a monorepo is a software-development strategy in which the code for a **number of projects** is stored in the **same repository**.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)

Pros:

- Ease of code reuse
- Simplified dependency management
- Atomic commits
- Large-scale code refactoring
- Collaboration across teams

Cons:

- Monorepos are expensive - it should be treated as a product that requires additional people and and special tools.
- More complex to setup and maintain - requires a team with specialized skills
- Version control scalability issues - simple git operations become slow
- Build system scalability issues - you can‚Äôt just run build or test command for your whole codebase.
- CI complexity - build and deployment pipelines become very complex
- Major dependency updates become hell - you need to do updates across a large codebase that no single person understands as a whole

Putting all your company code or code from different products in one repo **is not a good idea** if you are not Google, Meta, Microsoft‚Ä¶

It is much more practical and efficient to separate repositories per product area and enable teams to colocate related code and be autonomous.

‚áí Monorepo is not really mono üòâ

## Monorepos with Node.js

Historically Node.js had very poor support for structuring complex applications in one repository:

- Until npm 7 there was no standard way in Node.js to define multiple packages in one repository. npm introduced support for workspaces on 13th of October 20.
- Node.js doesn‚Äôt have internal build tool that understands dependencies between packages in one repo. Custom tools like lerna, nx, turborepo need to be used to run a task like build in correct order respecting all dependencies.

### What is a npm workspace?

> Workspaces is a generic term that refers to the set of features in the npm cli that provides support to **managing multiple packages** from your local file system from within a singular top-level, **root package**.

[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces)

### What is Turborepo?

> Turborepo is a high-performance build system for **JavaScript and TypeScript codebases**.

[https://turbo.build/repo](https://turbo.build/repo)

Features:

- Understands your workspace and can execute task in correct order üëç
- Can cache results of task executions - it doesn‚Äôt execute same task twice if no code has been changed ü•∞
- Understands git and can execute a task for only affected part of the codebase üò≤
- Supports remote task results caching - task gets executed once and everyone can reuse results locally ü§Ø

### Why Turborepo and not nx?

Currently nx is much more powerful tool than turborepo, here is my list of pros and cons.

Pros

- nx is around for many years and is developed by an amazing team.
- It supports all features from Turborepo and much more.
- It can be used for any language, not just Node.js.
- Has very advanced build features like distributed task execution!
- Has support for code templates.
- Has very nice dashboards that show how much time it saved you:

Cons

- Much more complex to setup and understand. It is a very generic and powerful tool and because of that it is simply harder to get started with.
- Wraps common tools in custom plugins with custom configuration forcing you to do setup your repo in a very different way. With Turborepo you setup everything as you usually would do and you just add it at the end in 5mins.
- Remote cache option is a paid feature, with Turborepo it is free and you can easily self-host it.

In general I would use nx if I had a really big repo, but on the other hand I don‚Äôt want to have a really big repo ever again üòâ

## Example

Lets build a dummy ecom website that has a frontend application and an api. We also need to have library of our design system components and we have some shared utilities like logger.

The purpose of the demo is to show how to implement common tasks in a Monorepo:

- [x] Running everything in development mode
- [x] Running lint
- [x] Running tests
- [x] Sharing configuration files for different tools
- [ ] Building docker images
- [ ] Pipeline
  - [ ] `test` and `lint` only affected packages

## Tools & Frameworks

- [npm workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to structure everything in one repo.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for frontend application.
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling `packages` and `apps`.
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for code style rules.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting rules.
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.

## Workspace Structure

Workspace consists of many npm packages. To create workspace with npm you need to follow these steps:

```bash
# create new empty directory for your monorepo
$ mkdir shop
$ cd shop
# init new npm package with default options
$ npm init -y
```

You will get `package.json` file which will be root for your workspace.

Root `package.json` needs to have `workspaces` property define and needs to be marked was `private`:

```json
{
  "name": "shop",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["configs/*", "packages/*", "apps/*"],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": ""
}
```

In workspaces we defined that we are going to put all our packages in three groups:

- `configs` will hold all packages with sharable configuration files for tools that we use. In our example we have `eslint-config-custom (eslint-config-custom)`, `tsconfig (@shop/tsconfig)` and `vite (@shop/vite)`.
- `apps` will hold all executable packages from our system. These can be `apis`, `websites`, `cli tools`, anything that is executed directly and not referenced like a package by anything else in the system. In our example we have `api (@shop/api)` and `website (@shop/website)`.
- `packages` will hold all packages that we want extract as logical or sharable parts of our codebase. These packages can be UI components or backend services that can be used by one or many `apps` or other `packages`. In our example we have: `logger (@shop/logger)` and `design-system (@shop/design-system)`.

Inside the workspace packages can reference each other like any other package on npm. For example in `@shop/api` in folder `apps/api` we want to use logger from `@shop/logger`, so we add it to `apps/api/package.json`:

```json
{
  //...
  "dependencies": {
    "@shop/logger": "*"
    //...
  }
}
```

Asterisk above means that we don't really care about the version of the package.

Once you setup your workspace you can execute all tasks for the whole repo from the root. For example lets say you want to run tests just for `@shop/api`:

```bash
$ npm run test -w @shop/api
```

you can also add additional params to the command, for example to run test in watch mode:

```bash
$ npm run test -w @shop/api -- --watch
```

## Package Structure

When we define a `package` or an `app` we want to define a set of commands that allow us to do usual development tasks, these commands are:

- `lint` to check the code style of all files in a package. We use `eslint` for this.
- `test` to run tests for a package. We use `vitest` for this.
- `build` to transpile typescript into javascript and to produce css from `scss` or any other way of defining styles. We use `vite` for this.
- `dev` to watch all the source files for changes and to re-build the package when change occurs. We use `vite` for this.

We will use typescript for all our code. And all our code will be transpiled only to ESM, this means that in each `package.json` you will see `"type": "module"`.

Also to make importing of a package easy, we define in each package exports like:

In `packages/logger`:

```json
//...
"exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.js",
    "./*": "./dist/*"
}
//...
```

This means that user of the package can import it like:

```js
import * as logger from '@shop/logger'; // imports packages/logger/dist/index.js
```

or to import styles for example:

```js
import '@shop/design-system/style.css'; // imports packages/design-system/dist/style.css
```

## Configs

Since we are going to potentially have many `packages` and `apps` in our repo, we need to make sure that we manage configuration of above tools efficiently. This means defining configuration once for each tool and for each use case and reuse this across the whole repo. In our case in `configs` folder we have following sharable configurations defined:

## eslint

Sharable configuration is defined in `configs/eslint-config-custom`. We use the global configuration in each of our packages like:

In `packages/logger/.eslintrc`:

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "extends": ["custom"] // eslint knows to look for package called "eslint-config-custom"
}
```

In eslint configuration we added also `prettier` configuration, so when we run eslint it will also check code formatting rules implemented by prettier.

## tsconfig

Sharable configuration is defined in `configs/tsconfig`. We have multiple configurations:

- `base.json` contains all common properties for all packages.
- `next.json` contains NextJS specific configuration.
- `react-library.json` contains configuration specific to react based packages.

We use sharable configurations like:

In `packages/logger/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "extends": "@shop/tsconfig/base.json", // extends from base configuration
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

## vite

Sharable configuration is defined in `configs/vite`. Configuration is defined to do following tasks:

- build everything only as ES modules
- build doesn't build any package dependency, only builds files inside of the package.
- build bundles everything to `dist/index.js` and if there are styles, they will be in `dist/styles.css`.
- build outputs `sourcemaps`, so that you can easily debug from typescript source files.
- build does typescript types check.
- build has an option to run a command when build is successful. We use this when we run `dev` command for `apps/api` to start the server after build.
- test contains configuration for vitest globals, so that you don't have to explicitly import `describe`, `it` in every `spec` file.
- includes `react` plugin, so that you don't have to import `react` in each `.tsx` file.

In general any build tool could work, as long as you implement above requirements.

## Turborepo

Once we have all packages setup, we need a tool that will orchestrate execution of different tasks across many different packages with respect to dependencies between them. For example, lets say that we want to build `@shop/api` looking at dependencies in `package.json` we see that it depends on `@shop/logger`, so it needs to be built first. Turborepo solves exactly this problem. Lets add turborepo to our repo.

From repo root:

```bash
$ npm install -D turbo
```

Add turbo.json with following content:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "next/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

The file above tells turborepo that we want it to handle `build`, `lint`, `test` and `dev`. It also tells turbo repo that commands `build`, `lint`, `test` can be cached, this means that once a command is executed, turborepo will store `stdout` and any files that you specify in `outputs` and if you execute the command again without changing any files in the package, it will just pull cached results without executing underlying command again. For `dev` command we don't want to cache any output and we define that build is required before dev.

In our root `package.json` we define following commands using turborepo in `scripts` section:

```json
{
  "test": "turbo run test",
  "test:affected": "turbo run test --filter=...[origin/main]",
  "lint": "turbo run lint",
  "lint:affected": "turbo run lint --filter=...[origin/main]",
  "lint:fix": "turbo run lint -- --fix",
  "build": "turbo run build",
  "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel"
}
```

As you can see from the above, turborepo has another great feature - running command for only affected part of our codebase! This means, if we change a file in `@shop/design-system`, when we run test command in our CI, **we want** to run tests only for `@shop/design-system` and `@shop/website` since it depends on design-system, but **we don't want** to run tests for `@shop/logger` and `@shop/api` since they are in no way affected by the changes we made. This can dramatically improve performance of our pipeline.
